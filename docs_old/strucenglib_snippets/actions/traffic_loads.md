This page shows the functionality of the function ``Normalspurverkehr_load_generator``. 

## Assumption and Restrictions
The current version of the ``Normalspurverkehr_load_generator`` has been developed for classic overpasses (frames/plate structures). The following restrictions apply:

- The Global origin must always be at x=0, y=0 and z=0.
- The Global origin must lie on the same plane as the plate.
- The Global origin is always on the lower left corner of the plate.
- Therefore the pate must extend in the positive x and y axis and lie completley in the xy plane.
- Loads are always defined in the direction of the local (negativ) z-direction.
- The local z-direction always points in the positive global z-axis
- The x-direction is always parallel to the edge of the plate
- Walls (constraints) are always parallel to the x and y axis, respectively.

## Functionality

The railways loads are defined using numerical inputs. Currentley no grafical input via the Rhino user Interface is suppoerted. 

```python
# ...

# Normalspurverkehr Load generator
return_values_Gleis_1=Normalspurbahnverkehr_load_generator(mdl,name='Gleis_1', l_Pl=10000, h_Pl=200, s=7500, beta=-30, q_Gl=-4.8*10000, b_Bs=1000, h_Strich=200, Q_k=-225*1000, y_A=5000)

# ...

# Steps
mdl.add([
    GeneralStep(name='step_1', displacements=['disp_left', 'disp_right'],nlgeom=False),
    GeneralStep(name='step_2', loads=return_values_Gleis_1, increments=1, nlgeom=False),
])
mdl.steps_order = ['step_1', 'step_2']

# ...

```

## Inputs

The following inputs are required:

| Parameter    | data type      | Description           |
| :---         | :---           | :---                  |
| ``mdl``      | object         | **Structure** Object (see [Link](https://compas.dev/compas_fea/latest/tutorial.html) for more information)  |
| ``name``     | string         | Name of the load |
| ``l_Pl``     | integer        | Length of the plate measured between plane of the supporting walls |
| ``h_Pl``     | integer        | high of the plate, haunches are not considered and a homogeneous plate thickness is assumed  |
| ``s``        | integer        | Distance bewtween global origin and start point of the track at y=0 |
| ``beta``     | integer        | Inclination of the track to the y-axis (positive clockwise, negative counterclockwise) |
| ``q_Gl``     | integer        | Dead weight of concrete sleeper and rail in N/mm |
| ``b_Bs``     | integer        | Width of the concrete sleeper |
| ``h_Strich`` | integer        | Gravel height between lower edge of railway sleeper and concrete slab |
| ``Q_k``      | integer        | Point load from train load model |
| ``y_A``      | integer        | Distance in y-direction between point load 1 and the origin |

## Output
The output (here names as return_values_Gleis_1) contains all layer names (strings) of the generated loads. The output can be assigned to the steps. The **AreaLoad* is generated automatically within the function ``Normalspurverkehr_load_generator``. In addition, the load application areas of the rails own weights and the centers of the loaded elements as well as the position of the rail loads, the corresponding load application areas and element centers are specified in separate Rhino layers.


## Example 
An example of how the function ``Normalspurverkehr_load_generator`` can be used in a structural analysis is found on this [link](https://github.com/StrucEng-Library-kfmresearch/strucenglib-snippets/tree/ansys/examples/Normalspurverkehr_load_generator)-

## Source Code
The function ``area_load_generator_elements`` is hosted and described in detail on [github](https://github.com/StrucEng-Library-kfmresearch/strucenglib-snippets/blob/ansys/strucenglib/prepost_functions/area_load_generator_elements.py).
