!!! note
    - The installer uses Compas to install Python dependencies into Rhino's include directory `%AppData%\McNeel\Rhinoceros\7.0\scripts`. 
    - Ensure that your Windows Environment variable `%PYTHONPATH%` is not set.
    - If you changed Rhino's `Modules Search Path` in Python Editor, please remove them ([Why](https://web.archive.org/save/https://compas.dev/compas_fea/latest/gettingstarted/installation.html)).
    - Install Script: [install_abaqus.bat](https://github.com/StrucEng-Library-kfmresearch/strucenglib-rhino3d-plugin/blob/master/StrucEngLib/EmbeddedResources/install_abaqus.bat).
